## Namespace
* Namespace is a context or scope in which identifiers (such as variables, functions, classes, etc.) are unique and can be used without conflicting with identifiers in other namespaces. 
* Scope defines the region of a program where a particular identifier can be accessed.There are three types of scopes:
  * Global scope: Variables are defined in global
  * Local scope: Variables that are inside a function.
  Global scope: Variables defined outside of any function or class have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere within the program.
Local scope: Variables defined within a function or a block of code have local scope and are only accessible within that function or block.
Enclosing scope (non-local scope): In some programming languages like Python, nested functions can access variables defined in their enclosing function's scope. These variables are neither in the global nor local scope of the nested function but are accessible within it.
